This project explores how the length of stay (stay) influences the mental health diagnostic scores of international students in the study. Using SQL, the analysis groups students by their reported stay duration and calculates:

count_int → The number of international students in each stay group.

average_phq → The average PHQ-9 (todep) depression test score, rounded to two decimals.

average_scs → The average SCS (tosc) self-compassion test score, rounded to two decimals.

average_as → The average ASISS (toas) acculturative stress score, rounded to two decimals.

The query returns a table with nine rows and five columns, presenting these values for each stay length. Results are sorted by stay in descending order to highlight longer durations first.

This analysis provides insights into the relationship between international students’ length of stay and their average mental health outcomes.
